## Performance Tweaks Guid

During the latest (start of June 2024) round of performance improvements we had to do quite a lot of performance related test, which were best done on the actual demo server.
In that time I accumulated quite a few CLI commands that can be helpful in the future.

## Getting inside the docker container

After ssh to the demo server.

```bash
docker container ls
```

If container name is not indicative of the url it is exposed in, then you can find more information via, `cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` for NGINX or `~/demo_server/env_files` for Caddy

Now you can enter container via

```bash
docker exec -ti {container id} /bin/bash
```

## Going to postgres

From within docker container

```bash
su postgres
psql
\c tmf_app_manager
```

use `exit` command (twice) to go back to the root user

## Restarting postgrahile without permissions

From within docker container

```bash
lsof -i tcp:5000 #lists id of running process 
kill -9 {process id} #replace {process id} with the node process from prev cmd
```

Then run postgraphile start as per: entry.sh, but remove -r graphile_user

## Quick way to check parts of your code

I've been updating rowLevelPolicyHelper.ts, and wanted to see how these new policies work on demo server

After updating the file locally, and doing `yarn build`

Copy newly built files from local computer

```bash
scp -i {key} {repo_root}/conforma-server/build/src/components/permissions/rowLevelPolicyHelpers.js ubuntu@d{demo server}:/home/ubuntu
```

Then from demo server (from server running the container)

```bash
docker cp rowLevelPolicyHelpers.js {container id}:/usr/src/conforma-server/build/src/components/permissions/
```

After that have to restart the server

From docker container

```bash
lsof -i tcp:8080
kill -9 {process id}
```

Then run server start, as per: entry.sh

https://github.com/msupply-foundation/conforma-server/blob/56dd0aaa1adda07f8b55099bd29fd4295def63fb/docker/entry.sh#L39

## Benching - PG Bench

From docker container, as root user

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install pgbench
```

Then go to postgres user and create bench file (can also copy with scp command, but it must be readable by postgres user)

```bash
su postgres
cd ~/
nano bench.sql
```

Paste your command, i.e.

```SQL
BEGIN;
set local "jwt.check" to '0,9,87,91,94,95,96,98,99,100,105,106,107,108,109,111,112,114,116,122,123,124,125,126,128,129,130,131,132,133,136,138,139,140,141,142,143,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194';

select * from application where template_id = any
(string_to_array(COALESCE(current_setting('jwt.check', true), '0'), ',')::integer[]);
COMMIT;
```

Then `ctrl + x, y`

```bash
pgbench -f bench.sql --log --transactions=30 tmf_app_manager
```

Example result

<details>
<summary>Example result</summary>
transaction type: bench.sql
scaling factor: 1
query mode: simple
number of clients: 1
number of threads: 1
maximum number of tries: 1
number of transactions per client: 30
number of transactions actually processed: 30/30
number of failed transactions: 0 (0.000%)
latency average = 10.976 ms
initial connection time = 4.228 ms
tps = 91.110639 (without initial connection time)
</details>

## Benching via graphql

In the browser inspector you can find the query and the variables under network -> payload (for the query you want to bench).

You can copy value of the query and variables, and paste it into the graphiql of the server. And after that you can edit authorisation header and see network tab while running individual queries

## Seeing how policies are generated

From the docker postgres you can get all policies via 

```
select json_agg(rules) from permission_policy;
```

Scroll down a little bit, copy the json, paste into your favorite formatter.

Then you can test their output using `rowLevelPolicyGeneration.test.ts`, (add print console commands where needed)
